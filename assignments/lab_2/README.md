# The purpose of this C program is to accept an arithmetic operation
# choice from the user, accept any number of integers, to perform that
# operation on said integers from left to right, and to output the final
# result.

# HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN #
To compile the code, navigate to the directory wherein you have the
source code and the makefile stored.

Enter the command "make" to call the makefile and compile the code into an executable
called "ccalc".

Run the executable by entering the command "./ccalc".

# HOW TO CLEAR EXECUTABLE #
To remove the executable, enter the command "make clean". Running
the code will require recompilation.
