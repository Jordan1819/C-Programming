# The purpose of this program is to utilize binary representation of
# hexadecimal integers and to apply logical binary operations. The program
# will prompt the user for an operator (|, &, and ^ (or, and, and xor)), the
# number of operands, and the hexadecimal operands. The program should then 
# perform the operation on the numbers in the form firstnum operator secondnum
# operator etc. The result should then be returned in both hexadecimal and
# binary.

# HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN #
To compile the code, navigate to the directory wherein you have the
source code and the makefile stored.

Enter the command "make" to call the makefile and compile the code into an executable
called "bitcalc".

Run the executable by entering the command "./bitcalc".

# HOW TO CLEAR EXECUTABLE #
To remove the executable, enter the command "make clean". Running
the code will require recompilation.
